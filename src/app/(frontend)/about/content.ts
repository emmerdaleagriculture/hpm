Plenty of farmers will tackle a paddock if it&rsquo;s near their yard and they&rsquo;ve got a slow week &mdash; but they&rsquo;ll fit you in around their real work, and the kit they bring is the kit they happen to own. That&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re lucky. It&rsquo;s not fine if you&rsquo;re trying to keep horses on a few acres and the field&rsquo;s becoming a problem.",
    "I run modern, well-maintained equipment that&rsquo;s actually right for paddock work. Tractors sized for the job &mdash; not the heavy farm gear that compacts the ground or can&rsquo;t get through a normal gateway. Toppers, harrows, rollers, sprayers, the lot. All kept in the yard, all serviced, all ready to go.",
